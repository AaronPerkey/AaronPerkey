# About Me:
I’m a computer science student at the University of Nebraska–Lincoln, focusing on software and game development. I specialize in C#, Python, and SQL, and I build full-stack applications with Angular and Electron. I also apply the same problem-solving mindset to designing games in Unity. The repositories below showcase my past work and current projects, reflecting both my technical growth and interests.
